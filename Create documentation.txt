We have to write documentation of React application with CRA, which is using Redux. We have to follow thee rules:

	Application description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences.
	Information on how to install/run the developed application locally.

Here are the components:

App.js
import './App.css';
import UserForm from './UserForm';
import UserTable from './UserTable';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <UserForm />
      <UserTable />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

UserForm.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import validator from 'validator';
import { setFirstName, setLastName, setEmail, setMessage, resetForm, addUser } from './reducer';

const UserForm = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const userData = useSelector(state => state.currentUser);  // get the user data from Redux store

  // Local state for form errors
  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    message: ''
  });

  const isFormValid = () => {
    return !Object.values(formErrors).some(error => error) &&
           Object.values(userData).every(data => data);
  };

  const handleChange = (e, setFunc) => {
    const { value } = e.target;
    dispatch(setFunc(value));  // using the action to set individual field data
    validateField(e.target.name, value);
  };

  const validateField = (name, value) => {
    let errors = { ...formErrors };
    switch (name) {
      case 'firstName':
      case 'lastName':
        errors[name] = !validator.isLength(value, { min: 2 }) ? 'Must be at least 2 characters' : '';
        break;
      case 'email':
        errors[name] = !validator.isEmail(value) ? 'Invalid email address' : '';
        break;
      case 'message':
        errors[name] = !validator.isLength(value, { min: 10 }) ? 'Must be at least 10 characters' : '';
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
    setFormErrors(errors);
  };

  const handleSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (isFormValid()) {
      console.log('Submitted data:', userData); // Do something with the data
      dispatch(addUser())
      dispatch(resetForm()); // Resetting the form data in the store
      setFormErrors({
        firstName: '',
        lastName: '',
        email: '',
        message: ''
      });
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" name="firstName" value={userData.firstName} onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, setFirstName)} placeholder="First Name" />
      {formErrors.firstName && <span>{formErrors.firstName}</span>}

      <input type="text" name="lastName" value={userData.lastName} onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, setLastName)} placeholder="Last Name" />
      {formErrors.lastName && <span>{formErrors.lastName}</span>}

      <input type="email" name="email" value={userData.email} onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, setEmail)} placeholder="Email" />
      {formErrors.email && <span>{formErrors.email}</span>}

      <textarea name="message" value={userData.message} onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, setMessage)} placeholder="Message"></textarea>
      {formErrors.message && <span>{formErrors.message}</span>}

      <button type="submit" disabled={!isFormValid()}>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default UserForm;

UserTable
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function UserTable() {
  const users = useSelector(state => state.users); // Updated the state to select the users array

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>

React Application Documentation
Application Description
This React application provides a user interface for collecting and displaying user details. Users can input their first name, last name, email, and a message via the form provided. Upon validation and submission, the user's details are then showcased in a table format, allowing for easy readability. Behind the scenes, the app utilizes Redux for state management, ensuring a streamlined flow of data and separating concerns between UI and state logic.

The UserForm component is responsible for collecting user data. It uses Redux for state management, where the current input is stored in the global state. The component also integrates data validation to ensure that the user's input meets certain criteria, e.g., minimum length requirements or email format checks. After a successful validation, the form's data is submitted, added to a list of users, and then the form is reset for a new entry. The UserTable component, on the other hand, retrieves the list of users from the Redux store and displays them in a structured table format.

How to Install/Run the Application Locally:
Prerequisites: Ensure you have node and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Clone the Repository: If the project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, you can clone it using:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory_name>
Install Dependencies: The project might have external dependencies that are required to run the application. Install them using:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server: Now that the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
After running the above command, your application should start, and it will typically be accessible via http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. You should see the user form and an initially empty table beneath it. As you add users via the form, they will populate this table.

Note: This application was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) and uses Redux for state management.

The documentation will be added in README.md file, do tyou think you have to add some additional things to the documentation and I just to copy the text to the file

When documenting a project in a README.md file, it's always a good idea to provide a comprehensive view to help other developers understand, install, and use your application. Here's an enhanced version of the documentation suitable for a README.md file:
